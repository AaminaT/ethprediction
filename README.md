# ETH Price Prediction
Ethereum’s transition from Proof of Work (PoW) to Proof of Stake (PoS) has made validator staking behavior a crucial indicator of network confidence and price movements. While traditional ETH price prediction methods rely on statistical methods (e.g, moving average), machine learning (ML) models are now extensively used for more precise forecasting. We aim to analyze ETH’s volatility by examining validator participation, staking rates, and transaction fee dynamics. Intuitively,  a higher staking rate and vaalidator count indicate strong confidence, reducing the circulating supply of ETH and potentially driving price growth, while unstaking events or staking centralization could introduce risks, By extracting key metrics from Ethereum’s full node and combining them with historical price data, we plan to train ML models to develop more accurate ETH price predictions.
	To overcome the scarcity and noisiness of labeled financial data, we implement a weak supervision approach using custom labeling functions to generate training labels without manual annotation, These functions incorporates domain heuristics and signal thresholds to approximate market movement labels (e.g., low/high/abstain), enabling scalable learning across a large historical dataset. 
	Our results show that models trained on validator-centric features ensembled with general market data outperform baseline models that rely solely on price history or volume. Incorporating weak supervision labeling improved classification accuracy by ??? over a naive threshold method. This work highlights the predictive value of consensus-layer metrics and demonstrates how on-chain analytics can be leveraged with market data for more informed price-forecasting.
